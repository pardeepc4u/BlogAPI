# EPAM Blog Services

## Problem statement 

Build a REST/JSON-based service (backend only) for blogging

User should be able to:

  ·       Submit a blog post with their name (unique nickhandle), title and content with the publish date

  ·       Update the blog post

  ·       View content posted by other users by their nicks ordered by creation time (newest first)

  ·       Comment on any post in a flat structure.

The project should have at least unit and integration tests. 
Maybe not thorough test suite, but showing the intention of how it will be tested

Feel free to use and document the assumptions for any uncertainties regarding this task

Expected tech.stack to be used:

  ·       Spring

  ·       Webflux (reactive programming)

  ·       MongoDB
